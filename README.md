# Learn Circle.js

## Intro

- You must know there is a [debate](http://staltz.com/why-react-redux-is-an-inferior-paradigm.html) between React+Redux v.s Circle.js

- [Cycle.js](http://cycle.js.org/)

- Learn how to build a simplified version of Circle.

- Check the on-line course on [egghead.io](https://egghead.io/series/cycle-js-fundamentals)

> The Course is by @andrestaltz, who created the Cycle.js

- This repo is the practice project while learning on it.

## Note

- I also wrote a note about how I learn from this tutorial in Chinese
